# MOSAIK API
The MOSAIK API is described by
* an [OpenAPI spec](openapi.yaml) that describes the resources of the API,
* a set of [ShEx Shapes](shapes.shex) for the RDF that describes the different Resources,
* and an [RDFS Vocabulary](vocabulary.ttl) to be used in the RDF that describes the different resources.

You can find further documentation and a tutorial with a smaller example of decentralized transportation system [in our MOSAIK documentation repo](https://github.com/wintechis/mosaik-runtime-documentation).
